## Bongquest 2

Another experiment in Phaser, this time to play with tilemaps, sprite animations, and to work towards something complex enough to require thought about code structure and organisation.

Currently it's a top-down Zelda ripoff starring Bongs, with Elvis from over the road as chief antagonist.  Gameplay leaves a little to be desired as of 30 August.
